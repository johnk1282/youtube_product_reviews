# Customer satisfaction from YouTube comments

YouTube has active and popular product review channels; however, customers' comments aren't explicitly linked to products or their satisfaction (i.e. explicit ratings) so the data is less structured and unlabeled. This analysis examines the extent to which customer satisfaction on YouTube product reviews can be inferred from a classifier trained on a large open-source dataset of Amazon product reviews.
