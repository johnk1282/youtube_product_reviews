# Inferring customer satisfaction from YouTube comments

YouTube has active and popular product review channels; however, customers' comments aren't explicitly linked to products or their sentiment/satisfaction (i.e. ratings) so the data is less structured and unlabeled. This analysis examines the extent to which customer satisfaction on YouTube product reviews can be inferred from a classifier trained on a large open-source dataset of labeled Amazon product reviews. The Amazon data is categorized by product which allows for domain-specific language models, and may be transferable to unlabeled YouTube data. This analysis could be particularly useful in determining customer satisfaction for products that aren't on Amazon (or other sites with active reviews), or in estimating demand for products where YouTube reviews drive purchases. This analysis uses laptop reviews as a product case study.
